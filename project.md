Final Project
=============

You will design a final research project by yourself or with one or two other
students with guidance from us. You have two options: a survey option and an 
empirical option. Survey projects must clearly analyze and synthesize a selection
of recent literature a topic related to machine translation. Empirical studies 
must clearly define a research problem and an experimental procedure with 
input, output, and evaluation measures. You should make an appointment with
the instructors to discuss your project prior to the first due date. To
keep you on track, there are three:

* BEFORE March 31: Meet with your instructors, by appointment.
* March 31: Project proposals (10 points)
* April 21: Interim report (5 points)
* May 7: Final project report (15 points)

All projects will be graded on a final written report.

Project Proposal
----------------
Your project proposal must identify a concrete research plan. A survey
proposal must clearly identify:

* A coherent research area related to machine translation. The research
area could be organized around a specific application, a technical 
problem, or a coherent set of methods for solving problems. The area
should be one that has not been surveyed before, or at least not 
recently.

* A set of initial papers to be surveyed.

* An outline of the themes that you expect to find, and questions that
you hope to learn answers to.

An empirical proposal must clearly idenfity:

* A single problem related to machine translation. Your problem should
be illustrated with an example and stated formally, ideally in the first
paragraph.

* An outline of your project. How will you solve the problem? What models 
and algorithms will you implement? What software will you use? 

* An experimental design. How will you know if you solved the problem?
You should clearly identify input, output, and evaluation measures.

The proposal is a contract. If we give you full credit for it, we expect
you to implement it and analyze the results, and we will give you full 
credit for the entire project if you do. If you turn in a weak proposal, 
you can revise it and resubmit it before moving forward. But the longer you 
take to define your project, the less time you will have to implement it, so
do the best you can for this early checkpoint.

Interim Report
--------------

For your interim report, you should have made substantial progress
on your project. For a survey, you should have read many of the papers,
identified main themes of the literature, and synthesized these into an 
outline. For an empirical project, you should have collected data, developed
baseline algorithms and metrics, and run preliminary experiments. Your 
interim report is an extension of your proposal, clarifying existing
material where requested, adding technical details of completed work, and 
outlining planned work. A reader should be able to answer these questions:

* What problem are you trying to solve or survey? Illustrate the problem with
examples and a give a precise technical description. Clearly identify inputs
and outputs. Be concise: if you don't hook your reader in the first paragraph
or so, they won't keep reading.

* Why is the problem important? If you could solve it, would you answer 
a scientific or mathematical question about language? Would you be able to 
build better, faster, or more usable systems than we can build now?

* Why is the problem hard? How do the obvious solutions fail? For an 
empirical project, answer this question by implementing and/ or running a 
baseline algorithm and analyzing the failure cases. For a survey paper, you
should find evidence in the literature.

* For an empirical paper: what is your proposed solution? Give a technical
description of your planned work, with enough detail that someone could
implement it. Your description should include an evaluation plan. For a 
survey paper: what are solutions that have been tried? Your description
should be convincing enough that your reader believes they'll learn
something interesting if they read all the way to the end of your 
(as yet unwritten!) final report.

The interim report should look much like a conference or workshop paper, with
some of the technical details and experimental results missing. To get a feel
for this style, read some papers from [the syllabus](syllabus.html). None of
them are perfect, so read actively: what do you find good or bad
about the writing in each paper? Emulate the styles that you find effective, 
and avoid those that are unclear or pedantic. Here is some more advice:

* [On writing well](http://www.amazon.com/Writing-Well-30th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/0060891548) by William Zinsser.
* [How to write a paper](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/giving-a-talk/writing-a-paper-slides.pdf) by Simon Peyton-Jones.
* [Mathematical writing](http://jmlr.org/reviewing-papers/knuth_mathematical_writing.pdf) by Donald Knuth.

Final Project Report and Poster Presentation
--------------------------------------------

Your final project report should extend your interim report, filling in 
missing technical details, experiments, and analysis. We will make our
expectations explicit in our comments on your interim report.

You will also present your research in a final poster session. Your poster
is a visual aid for a brief research talk, not a standalone description
of your work. That means that someone will learn about your work by talking
to you, not by reading the poster. The poster itself should include examples, 
concise descriptions of algorithms, and experimental results in tables 
or (preferably) charts. During the poster session, you'll explain your 
results multiple times in interactive conversations with your classmates
and instructors. Think of this as an [elevator pitch](http://www.elevatorpitchessentials.com/).
In a few minutes, can you explain what the problem is, why it's interesting,
how you tried to solve it, and what you learned? Try to interest
as many people in your problem (and solution) as you can. This
opening pitch can turn into a much longer conversation with someone who's
really interested. The goal is to learn from each other, brainstorm, and 
form new scientific collaborations.

Project Ideas
-------------

Many topics related to machine translation are welcome. Some suggestions:

* Extensions to Moses [as suggested here](http://www.statmt.org/moses/?n=Moses.GetInvolved)
* A new feature function for Moses ([some ideas](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W14-3360.pdf))
* Advanced decoding algorithms.
* Machine learning techniques for translation: neural networks, Bayesian models, etc.
* Principled methods for incorporating non-parallel data 
  (e.g., dictionaries, grammars, or thesauri) into translation models.
* Learning of pre-reordering models
* Translation models that incorporate morphology, syntax, or semantics.
* [Interactive machine translation](http://www.casmacat.eu/) that assists human translators.
* Experiment with different data conditions (social media text, speech, out-of-domain)
* Post-processing MT output (e.g., applying correct capitalization, removing unnecessary spaces,
  combining compounds)
* Pushing further on one of the homeworks, say by incorporating more advanced techniques and more
  data.
* [Writing your own MT class assignment](http://mt-class.org/penn/project.html)

Group Work
----------
Groups of any size are permitted. We will require an amount of work 
that is linear in group size, so you should take into account the overhead 
of group coordination when forming groups. Each group should turn in a single 
proposal identifying all members. All group members will receive the same grade, 
and you are stuck with your group members once your proposal is finalized: we 
refuse to adjudicate stories about who did or did not contribute.
